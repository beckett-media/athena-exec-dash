Black\'s spells similarly coerce sacrifice by the player or their opponent through cards or life. Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or MTG ) is a tabletop and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield . [1] Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro ), Magic was the first trading card game and had approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018 [update] , [2] [3] [4] and over twenty billion Magic cards were produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity. [5] [6] A player in Magic takes the role of a Planeswalker, doing battle with other players as Planeswalkers by casting spells, using artifacts, and summoning creatures as depicted on individual cards drawn from their individual decks. A player defeats their opponent typically (but not always) by casting spells and attacking with creatures to deal damage to the opponent\'s "life total," with the object being to reduce it from 20 to 0. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons , the gameplay bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games , while simultaneously having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games. Magic can be played by two or more players, either in person with printed cards or on a computer, smartphone or tablet with virtual cards through the Internet-based software Magic: The Gathering Online or other video games such as Magic: The Gathering Arena . It can be played in various rule formats, which fall into two categories: constructed and limited . Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards; [7] in constructed formats, players create decks from cards they own, usually with a minimum of 60 cards per deck. New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets . An organized tournament system (the WPN) played at the international level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has developed, as well as a substantial resale market for Magic cards. Certain cards can be valuable due to their rarity in production and utility in gameplay, with prices ranging from a few cents to tens of thousands of dollars. A standard game of Magic involves two or more players who are engaged in a battle acting as powerful wizards, known as Planeswalkers. Each player has their own deck of cards, either one previously constructed or made from a limited pool of cards for the event. A player starts the game with a "life total" of twenty and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero. A player can also lose if they must draw from their deck when no cards are left. In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game. [8] Cards in Magic: The Gathering have a consistent format, with half of the face of the card showing the card\'s art, and the other half listing the card\'s mechanics, often relying on commonly-reused keywords to simplify the card\'s text. Cards fall into generally two classes: lands and spells. Lands provide mana , or magical energy, which is used as magical fuel when the player attempts to cast spells. Players can only play one land card per turn, with most land providing a specific color of mana when they are "tapped" (usually by rotating the card 90 degrees to show it has been used that turn), with each land only able to be tapped for mana once per turn. Spells consume mana, typically with at least one or more mana of a specific color. More powerful spells cost more mana, so as the game progresses, more land will be in play, more mana will be available, and the quantity and relative power of the spells played tends to increase. Spells come in several varieties: non-permanents like "sorceries" and "instants" have a single, one-time effect before they go to the "graveyard" (discard pile); "enchantments" and "artifacts" that remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting magical effect; and "creature" spells summon creatures that can attack and damage an opponent as well as used to defend from the opponent\'s creature attacks. Land, enchantments, artifacts, and creature cards are considered permanents as they remain in play until removed by other spells, ability, or combat effects. The set Lorwyn introduced the new "planeswalker" card type, which represents powerful allies who fight with their own magic abilities. [9] Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards. [10] On each player\'s turn, following a set phase order, they draw a card, tap their lands and other permanents as necessary to gain mana as to cast spells, engage their creatures in a single attack round against their opponent who may use their own creatures to block the attack, and then complete other actions with any remaining mana. Tapped resources remain tapped until the start of the player\'s next turn, which may leave them without land to draw for mana to cast spells in reaction to their opponent, or without creatures to block attacks, so the player must also plan ahead for their opponent\'s turn. Most actions that a player can perform enter the "Stack", a concept similar to the stack in computer programming , as either player can react to these actions with other actions, such as counter-spells; the stack provides a method of resolving complex interactions that may result in certain scenarios. [11] See also: Magic: The Gathering deck types and Magic: The Gathering formats Deck building requires strategy as players must choose among thousands of cards which they want to play. This requires players to evaluate the power of their cards, as well as the possible synergies between them, and their possible interactions with the cards they expect to play against (this "metagame" can vary in different locations or time periods). [12] The choice of cards is usually narrowed by the player deciding which colors they want to include in the deck. This decision is a key part of creating a deck. In general, reducing the number of colors used increases the consistency of play and the probability of drawing the lands needed to cast one\'s spells, at the expense of restricting the range of tactics available to the player. [13] Part of the Magic product line has been starter decks which are aimed to provide novice players with ideas for deck building. [14] Players expand their card library for deck building through booster packs , which have a random distribution of cards from a specific Magic set and defined by rarity. These rarities are known as Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Mythic, with generally more powerful cards having higher rarities. Most sanctioned games for Magic: The Gathering under the WPN use the based Constructed format that require players to build their decks from their own library of cards. In general, this requires a minimum of sixty cards in the deck, and, except for basic land cards, no more than four cards of the same named card. [15] [16] The pool of cards is also typically limited to the Standard rotation, which consists of the base sets and expansions that have been released in the last two years. The Standard format helps to prevent "power creep" that can be difficult to predict with the size of the Magic card library and help give newer players a fair advantage with long-term players. Other Constructed formats exist that allow for use of older expansions to give more variety for decks. [17] A large variety of formats have been defined by the Wizards Play Network (WPN), formally the DCI, that allow different pools of expansions to be used or alter deck construction rules for special events. In the Limited format, a small number of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs, and a minimum deck size of forty cards is enforced. The most popular limited format is Booster Draft, in which players open a booster pack, choose a card from it, and pass it to the player seated next to them. This continues until all the cards have been picked, and then a new pack is opened. Three packs are opened in total, and the direction of passing alternates left-right-left. [18] Once the draft is done, players create 40-card decks out of the cards they picked, basic land cards being provided for free, and play games with the players they drafted with. There are no banned or restricted cards in limited formats. Individual cards may be listed as "restricted", where only one copy can be included in a deck, or simply "banned", at the WPN\'s discretion. [19] These limitations are usually for balance of power reasons, but have been occasionally made because of gameplay mechanics, for example, with the elimination of the "play for ante" mechanics in all formal formats, all such cards with this feature are banned. [20] [21] During the COVID-19 pandemic which drew more players to the online Magic games and generated volumes of data of popular deck constructions, Wizards was able to track popular combinations more quickly than in a purely paper game, and in mid-2020, banned additional cards that in specific combos could draw out games far longer than desired. [22] Older cards have been banned from all formal play by Wizards due to inappropriate racial or cultural depictions in their text or illustrations in the wake of the George Floyd protests , and their images have been blocked or removed from online Magic databases. [23] [24] This included a card called "Invoke Prejudice," which was displayed on the official card index site Gatherer "at a web URL ending in \'1488,\' numbers that are synonymous with white supremacy ." [24] These cards, Invoke Prejudice, Cleanse, Stone-Throwing Devils, Pradesh Gypsies, Jihad, Imprison, and Crusade, dated back to 1994. [25] [24] [23] The five colors of Magic: The Gathering Most cards in Magic are based on one of five colors that make up the game\'s "Color Wheel" or "Color Pie", shown on the back of each card, and each representing a school or realm of magic: white, blue, black, red, and green. The arrangement of these colors on the wheel describe relationships between the schools, which can broadly affect deck construction and game execution. For a given color such as white, the two colors immediate adjacent to it, green and blue, are considered complementary, while the two colors on the opposite side, black and red, are its opposing schools. The Research and Development (R&D) team at Wizards of the Coast aimed to balance power and abilities among the five colors by using the Color Pie to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of each. This guideline lays out the capabilities, themes, and mechanics of each color and allows for every color to have its own distinct attributes and gameplay. The Color Pie is used to ensure new cards are thematically in the correct color and do not infringe on the territory of other colors. [26] [27] The concepts behind each of the colors on the Color Wheel, based on a series of articles written by Mark Rosewater , are as follows: [28] White represents order, peace, and light, and draws mana from plains. White planeswalkers can summon individually weak creatures that are collectively strong as a group such as soldiers, as well as powerful creatures and leaders that can impart buffs (beneficial effects) [ ] across all of the player\'s creatures. Their spells tend to focus on healing or preventing damage, protecting their allies, and neutralizing an opponent\'s advantages on the battlefield. [29] [30] [31] Blue represents intellect, logic, manipulation, and trickery, and pulls its mana from islands. Its magic is typically associated with the classical elements of air and water . Many of Blue\'s spells can interact or interfere with the opponent\'s spells as well as with the general flow of the game. Blue\'s magic is also associated with control, allowing the player to gain temporary or full control of the opponent\'s creatures. Blue creatures often tend to be weak but evasive and difficult to target. [29] [30] [31] Black represents power, death, corruption, and sacrifice, drawing mana from swamps. Many of Black\'s creatures are undead , and several can be sacrificed to make other creatures more powerful, destroy opponent\'s creatures or permanents, or other effects. Black creatures may be able to draw the life taken in an attack back to their caster, or may even be able to kill creatures through a deathtouch effect. Black\'s spells similarly coerce sacrifice by the player or their opponent through cards or life. [29] [30] [31] Red represents freedom, chaos, fury, and warfare, pulling its power from mountains. Its powers are associated with the classical fire and earth elements, and tends to have the strongest spells such as fireballs that can be powered-up by tapping additional mana when cast. Red is an offense-oriented class: in addition to powerful creatures like dragons, red planeswalkers can summon weak creatures that can strike quickly to gain the short-term edge. [29] [30] [31] Green is the color of life, nature , evolution, and indulgence, drawing mana from forests. Green has the widest array of creatures to draw upon, ranging across all power levels, and generally is able to dominate the battlefield with many creatures at play at once. Green creatures and spells can generate life points and mana, and can also gain massive strength through spells. [29] [30] [31] Most cards in Magic: The Gathering are based on a single color, shown along the card\'s border. The cost to play them requires some mana of that color and potentially any amount of mana from any other color. Multicolored cards were introduced in the Legends expansion and typically use a gold border. Their casting cost includes mana from at least two colors plus additional mana from any color. Hybrid cards, included with Ravnica , use a two-color gradient border. These cards can be cast using mana from either color shown, in addition to other mana costs. Finally, colorless cards, such as some artifacts, do not have any colored mana requirements but still require a general amount of mana to be spent to play. The color wheel can influence deck construction choices. Cards from colors that are aligned such as red and green often provide synergistic effects, either due to the core nature of the schools or through designs of cards, but may leave the deck vulnerable to the magic of the common color in conflict, blue in the case of red and green. Alternatively, decks constructed with opposing colors like green and blue may not have many favorable combinations but will be capable of dealing with decks based on any other colors. There are no limits to how many colors can be in a deck, but the more colors in a deck, the more difficult it may be to provide mana of the right color. [27] Magic , like many other games, combines chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves the notion that there is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. [32] Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player\'s chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 , the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size. [33] A " mulligan " rule was introduced into the game, first informally in casual play and then in the official game rules. [34] In multiplayer, a player may take one mulligan without penalty, while subsequent mulligans will still cost one card (a rule known as "Partial Paris mulligan"). [35] The original mulligan allowed a player a single redraw of seven new cards if that player\'s initial hand contained seven or zero lands. A variation of this rule called a "forced mulligan" is still used in some casual play circles and in multiplayer formats on Magic Online , and allows a single "free" redraw of seven new cards if a player\'s initial hand contains seven, six, one or zero lands. [36] With the release of the Core Set 2020, a new mulligan system was introduced for competitive play known as the London Mulligan . Under this rule, after taking a mulligan, the player redraws 7 new cards, and then chooses 1 card to place on the bottom of their library for each mulligan they have taken (or chooses to mulligan again, drawing another 7 cards.) This mulligan rule is generally considered less punishing to mulligans than the prior mulligan rule, in which a player would simply draw one less card each time they mulliganed, rather than drawing 7 new cards after each mulligan, and subsequently choosing to \u201cbottom\u201d one card per mulligan taken. [37] [38] [39] Confessing his love for games combining both luck and skill, Magic creator Richard Garfield admitted its influence in his design of Magic . In addressing the complaint about luck influencing a game, Garfield states that new and casual players tend to appreciate luck as a leveling effect, since randomness can increase their chances of winning against a more skilled player. Meanwhile, a player with higher skills appreciates a game with less chance, as the higher degree of control increases their chances of winning. According to Garfield, Magic has and would likely continue decreasing its degree of luck as the game matured. [40] The "Mulligan rule", as well as card design, past vs. present, are good examples of this trend. He feels that this is a universal trend for maturing games. Garfield explained using chess as an example, that unlike modern chess, in predecessors, players would use dice to determine which chess piece to move. [40] The original set of rules prescribed that all games were to be played for ante . Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and added this rule because he wanted the players to play with the cards rather than simply collect them. [41] The ante rule stated that each player must remove a card at random from the deck they wished to play with before the game began, and the two cards would be set aside together as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading ownership of cards in play. The ante concept became controversial because many regions had restrictions on games of chance . The ante rule was soon made optional because of these restrictions and because of players\' reluctance to possibly lose a card that they owned. The gambling rule was also forbidden at sanctioned events. The last card to mention ante was printed in the 1995 expansion set Homelands . [42] [21] [43] Officially sanctioned Magic tournaments attract participants of all ages and are held around the world. These players in Rostock , Germany competed for an invitation to a professional tournament in Nagoya , Japan . Main articles: Magic: The Gathering Organized Play , Wizards Play Network , and Friday Night Magic The Wizards Play Network (WPN), formally the DCI, is the organizing body for sanctioned Magic events; it is owned and operated by Wizards of the Coast. The WPN establishes the set allowances and card restrictions for the Constructed and Limited formats for regulation play for tournaments as well as for other events. [44] "Thousands of games shops" participate in Friday Night Magic (FNM), [45] an event sponsored by the WPN; it is advertised as "the event where new players can approach the game, and start building their community". [46] FNM offers both sanctioned tournament formats and all casual formats. [44] [47] In 2018, The New Yorker reported that "even as it has grown in popularity and size, Magic flies low to the ground. It thrives on the people who gather at lunch tables, in apartments, or in one of the six thousand stores worldwide that Wizards has licensed to put on weekly tournaments dubbed Friday Night Magic". [48] FNM tournaments can act as a stepping-stone to more competitive play. [49] Magic tournaments regularly occur in gaming stores and other venues. Larger tournaments with hundreds of competitors from around the globe sponsored by Wizards of the Coast are arranged many times every year, with substantial cash prizes for the top finishers. [50] A number of websites report on tournament news, give complete lists for the most currently popular decks, and feature articles on current issues of debate about the game. [ By winning a yearly Invitational tournament, Jon Finkel won the right for this card to feature his design and likeness. The WPN runs the Pro Tour as a series of major tournaments to attract interest. [51] The right to compete in a Pro Tour has to be earned by either winning a Pro Tour Qualifier Tournament or being successful in a previous tournament on a similar level. A Pro Tour is usually structured into two days of individual competition played in the Swiss format . On the final day, the top eight players compete with each other in an elimination format to select the winner. [52] At the end of the competition in a Pro Tour, players are awarded Pro Points depending on their finishing place. If the player finishes high enough, they will also be awarded prize money. [52] Frequent winners of these events have made names for themselves in the Magic community, such as Gabriel Nassif , Kai Budde and Jon Finkel . As a promotional tool, the DCI launched the Hall of Fame in 2005 to honor selected players. [53] At the end of the year the Magic World Championship is held. The World Championship functions like a Pro Tour, except that competitors have to present their skill in three different formats (usually Standard, booster draft and a second constructed format) rather than one. Another difference is that invitation to the World Championship can be gained not through Pro Tour Qualifiers, but via the national championship of a country. Most countries send their top four players of the tournament as representatives, though nations with minor Magic playing communities may send just one player. The World Championship also has a team-based competition, where the national teams compete with each other. [54] At the beginning of the World Championship, new members are inducted into the Hall of Fame. The tournament also concludes the current season of tournament play and at the end of the event, the player who earned the most Pro Points during the year is awarded the title " Pro Player of the Year ". The player who earned the most Pro Points and did not compete in any previous season is awarded the title " Rookie of the Year ". [54] Invitation to a Pro Tour, Pro Points and prize money can also be earned in lesser tournaments called Grand Prix that are open to the general public and are held more frequently throughout the year. [55] Grand Prix events are usually the largest Magic tournaments, sometimes drawing more than 2,000 players. The largest Magic tournament ever held was Grand Prix: Las Vegas in June 2013 with a total of 4,500 players. [56] Richard Garfield had an early attachment to games during his youth: before settling down in Oregon , his father, an architect, had brought his family to Bangladesh and Nepal during his work projects. Garfield did not speak the native languages, but was able to make friends with the local youth through playing cards or marbles. Once back in the United States, he had heard of Dungeons & Dragons but neither his local game store nor his friends had a copy, so he developed his own version of what he thought the game would be based on the descriptions he had read, which considered closer to Clue , with players moving from room to room fighting monsters with a fixed end-goal. When Garfield eventually got copies of the Dungeon & Dragons rulesets, he was surprised that it was a more open-ended game but was "dreadfully written". [48] Dungeon & Dragons s open-endedness inspired him, like many others, to develop their own game ideas from it. [48] For Garfield, this was a game he called Five Magics , based on five elemental magics that were drawn from geographically-diverse areas. While this remained the core concept of Five Magics , Garfield continued to refine the game while growing up, often drastically changing the base type of game, though never planned to publish this game. [48] In 1991, Garfield was a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics at University of Pennsylvania and had been brought on as an adjunct professor at Whitman College . During his candidacy, he developed his ideas and had playtested RoboRally , a board game based on moving robots through a factory filled with hazards. Garfield had been seeking publishers for the title, and his colleague, Mike Davis, suggested the newly formed Wizards of the Coast , a small outfit established by Peter Adkison , a systems analyst for Boeing in Seattle. [57] [48] In mid-1991, the three arranged to meet in Oregon near Garfield\'s parents\' home. Adkison was impressed by RoboRally but considered that it had too many logistics and would be too risky for him to publish. He told Garfield and Davis that he liked Garfield\'s ideas and that he was looking for a portable game that could be played in the downtime that frequently occurs at gaming conventions . [57] After the meeting, Garfield remained in Oregon to contemplate Adkison\'s advice. While hiking near Multnomah Falls , he was inspired to take his Five Magics concept but apply it to collectible color-themed cards, so that each player could make a customizable deck, something each player could consider part of their identity. [48] Garfield arranged to meet with Adkison back in Seattle within the week, [58] and when Adkison heard the idea, he recognized the potential that this would be a game that could be expanded on indefinitely with new cards in contrast to most typical tabletop games; Adkison later wrote on the idea on a USENET post "If executed properly, [the cards] would make us millions." [48] Adkison immediately agreed to produce it. [59] Garfield returned to Pennsylvania and set off designing the game\'s core rules and initial cards, with about 150 completed in the few months after his return. The type of gameplay centered on each color remained consistent with how Five Magics had been and with how Magic: The Gathering would stay in the future, such as red representing aggressive attacks. [57] Other games also influenced the design at this point, with Garfield citing games like Cosmic Encounter and Strat-o-matic Baseball as games that differ each time they are played because of different sets of cards being in play. [60] Initial "cards" were based on using available copyrighted art, and copied to paper to be tested by groups of volunteers at the university. [57] About six months after the meeting with Adkison, Garfield had refined the first complete version of his game. [57] Garfield also began to set the narrative of the game in "Dominia", a multiverse of infinite "planes" from which players, as wizards, can draw power from, which would allow for the vast array of creatures and magics that he was planning for the cards. [60] Garfield has stated that two major influences in his creation of Magic: the Gathering were the games Cosmic Encounter , [61] which first used the concept that normal rules could sometimes be overridden, and Dungeons & Dragons . The "Golden Rule of Magic " states that "Whenever a card\'s text directly contradicts the rules, the card takes precedence." [62] The Comprehensive Rules , a detailed rulebook, exists to clarify conflicts. [63] Simultaneously, Adkison sought investment into Wizards of the Coast to prepare to publish the game. The company had already committed to completing The Primal Order rulebook, aimed to be compatible with most other role-playing systems on the market, which most investment was drawn to. He had to bring in a number of local Cornish artists to create the fantasy art for Garfield\'s cards, offering them shares in Wizards of the Coast in payment. [57] After The Primal Order was published in 1992, Wizards of the Coast was sued by Palladium for copyright infringement, a case that was settled out of court and with the result that a second printing of The Primal Order removed the rules relevant to Palladium\'s system, but this case also financially harmed Wizards of the Coast. [57] Adkison decided to create a separate company, Garfield Games, for publishing the card game. [57] While the game was simply called Magic through most of playtesting, when the game had to be officially named a lawyer informed them that the name Magic was too generic to be trademarked. Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of the game. However, everybody involved with the game continued to refer to it simply as Magic . After further legal consultation, it was decided to rename the game Magic: The Gathering , thus enabling the name to be trademarked. [64] By 1993, Garfield and Adkison had gotten everything ready to premiere Magic: The Gathering at that year\'s Gen Con in Milwaukee that August, but did not have the funds for a production run to have shipped to game stores in time. Adkison took a single box of cards with a handful of complete decks to the Wizards booth at Origins Game Fair hoping to secure the funds by demonstrating the game. Among those he demonstrated to were representatives of Wargames West, manufacturers of historical tactics games; the representatives eventually brought their CEO over, and after seeing the game, took Adkison to dinner and negotiated funding terms. Adkison returned with , enough to make the necessary orders. [57] Magic: The Gathering underwent a general release on August 5, 1993. [65] After shipping the orders, Adkison and his wife drove towards Milwaukee while making stops at game stores and demonstrate the game to drum up support for Gen Con. Their initial stops were quiet, but word of mouth from previous stops spread, and as they traveled south and west, they found larger and larger crowds anxiously awaiting their arrival. [57] Garfield met up with Adkison at Gen Con, where their shipment of 2.5 million cards had been delayed a day. Despite this, by the end of the convention, they had completely sold out. [57] Magic was an immediate success for Wizards of the Coast. [66] By October 1993, they had sold out their supply of 10 million cards. [67] Wizards was even reluctant to advertise the game because they were unable to keep pace with existing demand. [68] Initially Magic attracted many Dungeons & Dragons players, [68] but the following included all types of other people as well. [69] The success of the initial edition prompted a reissue later in 1993, along with expansions to the game. Arabian Nights was released as the first expansion in December 1993. New expansions and revisions of the base game ("Core Sets") have since been released on a regular basis, amounting to four releases a year. By the end of 1994, the game had printed over a billion cards. [70] Until the release of Mirage in 1996, expansions were released on an irregular basis. Beginning in 2009 one revision of the core set and a set of three related expansions called a "block" were released every year. This system was revised in 2015, with the Core Set being eliminated and blocks now consisting of two sets, released semiannually. A further revision occurred in 2018, reversing the elimination of the core sets and no longer constraining sets to blocks. While the essence of the game has always stayed the same, the rules of Magic have undergone three major revisions with the release of the Revised Edition in 1994, Classic Edition in 1999, and Magic 2010 in July 2009. [71] With the release of the Eighth Edition in 2003, Magic also received a major visual redesign. In 1996, Wizards of the Coast established the " Pro Tour ", [53] a circuit of tournaments where players can compete for sizeable cash prizes over the course of a single weekend-long tournament. In 2009 the top prize at a single tournament was US$ 40,000. [50] Sanctioned through the DCI, the tournaments added an element of prestige to the game by virtue of the cash payouts and media coverage from within the community. For a brief period of time, ESPN2 televised the tournaments. [72] By April 1997, 2 billion cards had been sold. [73] In 1999, Wizards of The Coast was acquired by Hasbro for $325 million, making Magic a Hasbro game. A patent was granted to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 for "a novel method of game play and game components that in one embodiment are in the form of trading cards" that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of Magic\' s elements in combination, including concepts such as changing orientation of a game component to indicate use (referred to in the rules of Magic and later of Garfield\'s games such as Vampire: The Eternal Struggle as "tapping") and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool. [74] The patent has aroused criticism from some observers, who believe some of its claims to be invalid. [75] In 2003, the patent was an element of a larger legal dispute between Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo , regarding trade secrets related to Nintendo\'s Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game . The legal action was settled out of court, and its terms were not disclosed. [76] While unofficial methods of online play existed previously, [note 1] Magic Online (often shortened to "MTGO" or "Modo"), an official online version of the game, was released in 2002. A new, updated version of Magic Online was released in April 2008. [77] In February 2018, Wizards noted that between the years of 2008 and 2016 they had printed over 20 billion Magic: the Gathering cards. [78] See also: List of Magic: The Gathering sets Magic: The Gathering cards are produced in much the same way as normal playing cards . Each Magic card, approximately 63 \u00d7 88 mm in size (2.5 by 3.5 inches), has a face which displays the card\'s name and rules text as well as an illustration appropriate to the card\'s concept. 23,318 unique cards have been produced for the game as of September 2016 [update] , [79] many of them with variant editions, artwork, or layouts, and 600\u20131000 new ones are added each year. The first Magic cards were printed exclusively in English, but current sets are also printed in Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Portuguese , Russian , and Spanish . [80] The overwhelming majority of Magic cards are issued and marketed in the form of sets. For the majority of its history there were two types: the Core Set and the themed expansion sets. Under Wizards of the Coast\'s current production and marketing scheme, a new set is released quarterly. Various products are released with each set to appeal to different segments of the Magic playing community: The majority of cards are sold in booster packs , which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities, which can be differentiated by the color of the expansion symbol. [note 2] A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land. Shards of Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one in eight rare cards on average. There are also premium versions of every card with holographic foil, randomly inserted into some boosters in place of a common, which replace about one in seventy cards. Each set since Kaladesh features two Planeswalker decks, which are meant to help new players learn the game. They contain a 60-card pre-constructed deck with an exclusive Planeswalker, as well as several exclusive cards, two booster packs from the set they accompany, as well as a rule guide and a card board box with an image of the included Planeswalker. Each set from Shards of Alara to Eldritch Moon featured five Intro Packs, which fulfilled the same function as planeswalker decks. They contained a 60-card pre-constructed deck, as well as two booster packs from the set they accompany and a rule guide. Each set from Mirrodin Besieged to Gatecrash featured two Event Decks, which were pre-constructed decks designed as an introduction to tournament play. Beginning with Dragon\'s Maze , each set featured only one Event Deck. However, event decks were discontinued after the set " Battle for Zendikar ". Previously, cards were also sold in Tournament Packs typically containing three rares, ten uncommons, thirty-two commons, and thirty basic lands. [note 3] Tournament Packs were discontinued after Shards of Alara . As of 2018, the number of consecutive sets set on the same world varies. [81] For example, although Dominaria takes place in one set, the Guilds of Ravnica block takes place over three sets. In addition, small sets have been removed due to developmental problems and all sets are now large. Prior to this change, sets were put into two-set blocks, starting with a large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. [82] Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. In contrast with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion focuses on a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards to a handful of particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics. [81] The Core Sets began to be released annually (previously biennially) in July 2009 coinciding with the name change from 10th Edition to Magic 2010 . This shift also introduced new, never before printed cards into the core set, something that previously had never been done. [83] However, core sets were discontinued following the release of Magic Origins , on July 17, 2015, at the same time that two-set blocks were introduced. [82] Wizards of Coast announced on June 12, 2017 that they plan on revamping and reintroducing a revamped core set , [84] and Core Set 2019 was released on July 13, 2018. In addition to the quarterly set releases, Magic cards are released in other products as well, such as the Planechase and Archenemy spin-off games. These combine reprinted Magic cards with new, oversized cards with new functionality. Magic cards are also printed specifically for collectors, such as the From the Vault and Premium Deck Series sets, which contain exclusively premium foil cards. In 2003, starting with the Eighth Edition Core Set, the game went through its biggest visual change since its creation\u2014a new card frame layout was developed to allow more rules text and larger art on the cards, while reducing the thick, colored border to a minimum. [85] The new frame design aimed to improve contrast and readability using black type instead of the previous white, a new font, and partitioned areas for the name, card type, and power and toughness. The card frame was changed once again in Core Set 2015 , which maintained the same templating, but made the card sleeker and added a holo-foil stamp to every rare and mythic card to curtail counterfeiting. For the first few years of its production, Magic: The Gathering featured a small number of cards with names or artwork with demonic or occultist themes, in 1995 the company elected to remove such references from the game. In 2002, believing that the depiction of demons was becoming less controversial and that the game had established itself sufficiently, Wizards of the Coast reversed this policy and resumed printing cards with "demon" in their names. [86] In 2019, starting with Throne of Eldraine , booster packs have a chance of containing an alternate art "showcase card". This is to increase the reward of buying boosters and making it more exciting. [87] A new format, "Jumpstart", was introduced in July 2020 alongside the Core 2021 set. These are special themed 20-card booster packs, based on nearly 500 cards, several being reprints of cards from previous sets, with 121 possible packs available. Each is a curated set rather than random selection of cards, built around a theme, such as "Pirates" or "Unicorns". Each theme has a small number of possible card sets on that threme, distributed on a rarity basis, such that the specific booster that a player purchases will still be a random selection. Because many are reprints, not all Jumpstart cards are available to be used in the various Constructed formats but can be used in other modes of play. [88] Jumpstart was designed to make it much easier to get into Magic by eliminating the deck-building but still providing some customization and randomness that comes with card acquisition and deck building. A special Jumpstart format was introduced for these boosters, where players select two desired themes, and are given a random booster from those themes and sufficient land cards to make a 60-card deck. [89] Main article: Multiverse (Magic: The Gathering) Garfield had established that Magic: The Gathering took place in a Multiverse with countless possible worlds (planes), the game\'s primary events taking place on the plane of Dominaria, and unique and rare beings called Planeswalkers are capable of traversing the Multiverse. This allows the game to frequently change worlds so as to renew its mechanical inspiration, while maintaining planeswalkers as recurrent, common elements across worlds. Players represent planeswalkers able to draw on the magics and entities of these planes to do battle with others. Story elements were told through the cards\' flavor text , but otherwise without any driving narrative. [90] The first expansion Arabian Nights designed by Garfield was based on One Thousand and One Nights folklore and include figures from that like Aladdin . [91] Early expansions were designed separately, each with their own internal narrative to establish concepts, keywords, and flavoring. [90] [91] With Weatherlight , the team wanted to start a longer arc that would cover multiple expansions over five years that would also extend into comics, magazines, and other media. [92] [93] However, with a change in oversight of the Magic: The Gathering team, player fatigue, and a disconnect between the novels and cards, this plan was scrapped. returning to the general approach of designing a narrative specific to one expansion. [90] Wizards, which had regained the license from Harper Prism and Armada (an imprint of Acclaim Entertainment ) to write novels for Magic: The Gathering , still worked to integrate the novel writing staff with the game designers so that there was some cohesion between the game and books, but did not seek to make this a key priority as the Weatherlight goal had been. [90] [94] Novels soon gave way to eBooks and later to shorter stories posted on the Wizards\' website which fared better in terms of popularity. [95] In 2017, Wizards hired novelist and scriptwriter Nic Kelman as their Head of Story and Entertainment. Kelman became responsible for crafting the Magic: The Gathering story bible from all established lore as reference for further expansions and for the external media. [96] This task helped Kelmen to prepare the novel War of the Spark: Ravnica that was published just prior to the new set War of the Spark , with cards retaining continuity with the novel and past events. [97] See also: List of Magic: The Gathering artists Each card has an illustration to represent the flavor of the card, often reflecting the setting of the expansion for which it was designed. Much of Magic \'s early artwork was commissioned with little specific direction or concern for visual cohesion. [98] One infamous example was the printing of the creature Whippoorwill without the "flying" ability even though its art showed a bird in flight. [99] The art direction team later decided to impose a few constraints so that the artistic vision more closely aligned with the design and development of the cards. Each block of cards now has its own style guide with sketches and descriptions of the various races and places featured in the setting. [100] A few early sets experimented with alternate art for cards. However, Wizards came to believe that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. [101] Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. [note 4] When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast usually prints them with new art to make the older cards more collectible, [102] though they sometimes reuse well-received artwork if it makes sense thematically. At the back of each card, at the end of the word "Deckmaster", a pen stroke is visible. According to Wizards of the Coast, this is a printing error which was never corrected, as all card backs have to look the same. [103] As Magic has expanded across the globe, its artwork has had to change for its international audience. Artwork has been edited or given alternate art to comply with the governmental standards. For example, the portrayal of skeletons and most undead in artwork was prohibited by the Chinese government until 2008. [104] [105] Wizards of the Coast has introduced specials cards and sets that include cross-promotional elements with other brands typically as promotional cards, not legal for Standard play and may not be playable even in eternal formats. Four promotional cards were sold at HasCon 2017, featuring three other Hasbro brands, Transformers , Nerf , and Dungeons & Dragons . [106] A special three-card set based on characters from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (another Hasbro brand) was sold as both physical product and digital items within MTG Arena to support the Extra Life charity. [107] The "Ikoria, Lair of Behemoths" set released in April 2020 included 16 kaiju monsters from Toho as promotional cards, such as Godzilla . [108] [109] The new Universes Beyond series will bring other crossover properties into Magic such as Warhammer 40,000 and The Lord of the Rings . [110] Polygon reported that the Lord of the Rings themed set, planned for 2023, "will be a complete, Modern-legal set of cards" and "it will be a full product line. That means players will be able to draft cards for pick-up play, and compete in multiplayer games with one of four preconstructed Commander decks". [111] The Secret Lair promotional series has also been used to introduce crossover cards from other brands. As part of the Secret Lair set in 2020, a number of cards were made that featured crossovers with AMC \'s television show The Walking Dead , which the development team felt was a natural fit since zombies were already part of the Magic game. [112] A limited set of land cards in the Secret Lair featured paintings from Bob Ross , licensed through his estate. [113] In June 2021, Wizards of the Coast announced a Secret Lair based on Dungeons and Dragon cartoon . [114] A planned 2021 Secret Lair drop will feature cards based on Stranger Things , [115] while Fortnite and Street Fighter will be featured in the Secret Lair drop in 2022. [116] [117] Additionally, Wizards has continued to develop a strong connection between the Magic and the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) universes . Greg Tito, Wizards of the Coast Senior Communications Manager, said that "there is a huge crossover between Magic players and D&D players". [118] In July 2021, a D&D themed set expansion, Adventures in the Forgotten Realms , was released; it is based on the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. [119] [120] Separately, elements of Magic have been brought into the role-playing game. The first such official crossover was a D&D campaign setting book for the plane of Ravnica , a Magic expansion introduced in 2005 and 2006 and later revisited in the 2018 expansion Guilds of Ravnica . [121] [122] Guildmasters\' Guide to Ravnica was also published in 2018 to correspond with the newer Magic expansion\'s release. [122] A second campaign setting book, Mythic Odysseys of Theros (2020), introduced the plane of Theros to D&D and corresponded with the 2020 Theros Beyond Death expansion. [123] Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos (2021) introduces the 2021 Magic expansion as a D&D campaign setting; [124] it was released in December 2021. [125] Scott Haring reviewed Magic: The Gathering in Pyramid #4 (Nov./Dec., 1993), and stated that "Not only is Magic the best gaming bargain to come down the pike in memory; not only is it the most original idea in years; it\'s also a delightfully addictive game that you and your friends will find impossible to put down." [126] A 2004 article in USA Today suggested that playing Magic might help improve the social and mental skills of some of the players. The article interviewed players\' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs . On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children\'s Magic obsession. [127] In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships. [128] Jordan Weisman , an American game designer and entrepreneur, commented, "I love games that challenge and change our definition of adventure gaming, and Magic: The Gathering is definitely one of a very short list of titles that has accomplished that elusive goal. By combining the collecting and trading elements of baseball cards with the fantasy play dynamics of role-playing games, Magic created a whole new genre of product that changed our industry forever." [129] In 2015, The Guardian reported that an estimated 20 million people played Magic around the world and that the game had a thriving tournament scene, a professional league and a weekly organized game program called Friday Night Magic . [45] A July 2019 article in Bloomberg reported that " Magic is part of the [Hasbro\u2019s] \'franchise brands,\' a segment that accounted for $2.45 billion in net revenue for the company last year, bigger than its emerging, partner and gaming brand units combined. [Chris] Cocks said Magic accounts for a \'meaningful portion\' of that, with KeyBanc estimating the game\u2019s contribution is already more than $500 million\u2014including both the physical cards and the nascent digital version. Of the franchise brands, only Magic and Monopoly logged revenue gains last year". [130] Magic: The Gathering Arena , in open beta testing since September 2018, is a free-to-play digital collectible card game with microtransaction purchases based on Magic . [131] [132] Brett Andress, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets , predicts Magic: The Gathering Arena adding as much as 98 cents a share in incremental earnings to results by 2021 (which is at least a 20% boost). [130] Joe Deaux, for Bloomberg , wrote that "nearly 3 million active users will be playing Arena by the end of this year, KeyBanc estimates, and that could swell to nearly 11 million by 2021 according to its bull case scenario\u2014especially if it expands from PCs to mobile. That\u2019s just active users, and registered users could be higher by the millions. Already, according to Hasbro, a billion games have been played online". [130] The success of Magic: The Gathering led to the creation of similar games by other companies as well as Wizards of the Coast themselves. Companion Games produced the Galactic Empires CCG (the first science fiction trading card game), which allowed players to pay for and design their own promotional cards, while TSR created the Spellfire game, which eventually included five editions in six languages, plus twelve expansion sets. Wizards of the Coast produced Jyhad (now called Vampire: The Eternal Struggle ), a game about modern-day vampires. Other similar games included trading card games based on Star Trek and Star Wars . [69] Magic is often cited as an example of a 1990s collecting fad, though the game\'s makers were able to overcome the bubble traditionally associated with collecting fads. [143] Its popularity often was associated with addictive behavior similar to gambling through the allure of gaining new cards in booster packs and expansions, and due to this, Magic: The Gathering has been sometimes derogatorily called "cardboard crack". [144] [145] The Alpha version of the Black Lotus card (here, signed by the artist) is usually considered to be the most valuable non-promotional Magic card ever printed, aside from misprinted cards. [146] There is an active secondary market in individual cards among players and game shops. This market arose from two different facets: players seeking specific cards to help complete or enhance their existing decks and thus were less concerned on the value of the cards themselves, and from collectors seeking the rarer cards for their monetary value to complete collections. [147] Many physical and online stores sell single cards or "playsets" of four of a card. Common cards rarely sell for more than a few cents and are usually sold in bulk. Uncommon cards and weak rare cards typically sell from 10\u00a2 up to $1. The more expensive cards in Standard tournament play - a rotating format featuring the newest cards designed to be fairer and more accessible to newer players - are typically priced between $1 and $25. A second format, Modern, comprising an intermediate level of power and allowing most cards released since roughly 2003, has staple cards that often value between $5 and $100, with higher rarity and demand but reprints every few years intended to keep the format affordable. Foil versions of rare and mythic rare cards are typically priced at about twice as much as the regular versions. Some of the more sought-after rare and mythic rare cards can have foil versions that cost up to three or four times more than the non-foil versions. [148] A few of the oldest cards, due to smaller printings and limited distribution, are highly valued and rare. This is partly due to the Reserved List, a list of cards from the sets Alpha to Urza\'s Destiny (1994\u20131999) that Wizards has promised never to reprint. [149] Legacy-only cards on the Reserved List, which are barred from reprint under a voluntary but genuine legal obligation, are in short supply due to smaller print runs of the game in its oldest days, and may be worth $200 to $1,000 or higher. And certain Vintage cards - the oldest cards in Magic, with most on the Reserved List, such as the so-called " Power Nine " - can easily cost more than $1,000 apiece. The most expensive card that was in regular print (as opposed to being a promotional or special printing) is the Black Lotus , which are currently worth thousands of dollars. In 2019, an unsigned "Pristine 9.5 grade" Beckett Grading Services graded Alpha Black Lotus was bought by an anonymous buyer for a record $166,100. [150] A PSA "Gem Mint 10" graded Alpha Black Lotus in pristine condition, framed in a case signed by its artist Christopher Rush, was sold at auction for in January 2021. [151] The secondary market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards\' values determined somewhat arbitrarily by the employees of the store. Hobbyist magazines, already tracking prices of sports trading cards , engaged with the Magic secondary market by surveying the stores to inquire on current prices to cards, which they then published. [147] With the expansion of the Internet, prices of cards were determined by the number of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). [152] [147] When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic secondary market evolved substantially, with the site TCGPlayer.com launched in 2008 being the first that not only compiled the pricing data but allowed for players to buy and sell cards for Magic and other CCGs directly via the site. TCGPlayer developed a metric called the TCG Market Price for each card that was based on the most recent sales, allowing for near real-time valuation of a card in the same manner as a stock market . [147] Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. [153] Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research called Magic: The Gathering finance . [154] Some people make a career out of market manipulation , creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards\' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards. [155] [156] Magic s economy has also been tied to the introduction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as Magic cards represent a physical asset that can be converted back and forth into the virtual currency. [147] Nearly all of Magic s trading market is unregulated, and issues related to insider trading based on planned changes to the game have occurred. Active Magic financial traders have gained a sour reputation with more casual Magic players due to the lack of regulations, and that the market manipulations makes it costly for casual players to buy single cards simply for purposes for improving decks. [147] As of late 2013, Wizards of the Coast has expressed concern over the increasing number of counterfeit cards in the secondary market. [157] Wizards of the Coast has since made an effort to counteract the rise of counterfeits by introducing a new holofoil stamp on all rare and mythic rare cards as of Magic 2015 . [158] There are several examples of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning different aspects of Magic: The Gathering . One study examined how players use their imaginations when playing. This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative. [159] Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. [160] A third example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. [161] Using a specific set of cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete . [162] [ ] Further, by proving this, the researchers assert that Magic: The Gathering is so complex as to be Turing complete and capable of being "programmed" to perform any task, that in terms of playing an actual game of Magic , "the winning strategy is non-computable", making it an improbable challenge to devise computer opponents that can play Magic in a mathematically optimal manner. [163] In 2015 Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro published Magic: The Gathering \u2013 Arena of the Planeswalkers . Arena of the Planeswalkers is a tactical boardgame where the players maneuver miniatures over a customizable board game, and the ruleset and terrain is based on Heroscape , but with an addition of spell cards and summoning. The original master set includes miniatures that represent the five Planeswalkers Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, and Nissa as well as select creatures from the Magic: The Gathering universe. [164] They later released an expansion Battle for Zendikar featuring multi-color Planeswalkers Kiora and Ob Nixilis and a colorless Eldrazi Ruiner, and a second master set Shadows Over Innistrad which has 4 new Planeswalkers and also includes the addition of cryptoliths. See also: Magic: The Gathering video games There are currently two official video game adaptions of Magic: The Gathering for online play. Magic: The Gathering Online , first introduced in 2002, allows for players to buy cards and boosters and play against others including in officially-sanctioned tournaments for prize money. Magic: The Gathering Arena , introduced in 2019, is fashioned after the free-to-play Hearthstone , with players able to acquire new cards for free or through spending real-world funds. Arena currently limited online events with in-game prizes, but is currently being positioned by Wizards of the Coast to also serve as a means for official tournament play, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic . Both Online and Arena are regularly updated with new Core and Expansion cards as well as all rule changes made by Wizards. [165] In addition, Wizards of the Coast has worked with other developers for various iterations of Magic: The Gathering as a card game in a single-player game format. Microprose developed 1997 Magic: The Gathering and its expansions, which had the player travel the world of Shandalar to challenge computer opponents, earn cards to customize their decks, improve their own Planeswalker attributes and ultimately defeat a powerful Planeswalker. Stainless Games developed a series of titles starting with 2009\'s Magic: The Gathering \u2013 Duels of the Planeswalkers and culminating with 2015\'s Magic Duels , a free-to-play title. The Duels series did not feature full sets of Magic cards but selected subsets, and were initially designed to couple a challenging single-player experience with an advanced artificial-intelligence computer opponent. Later games in the series added in more deck-building options and multiplayer support. [165] [166] Additional games have tried other variations of the Magic: The Gathering gameplay in other genres. Acclaim developed a real-time strategy game Magic: The Gathering: BattleMage in 2003, in which the player\'s abilities were inspired by the various cards. [165] [167] Acclaim also had made a 1997 arcade game Magic: The Gathering \u2014 Armageddon , a Breakout -style trackball -based game, but only as many as six cabinets were known to have been made. [165] Hiberium and D3 Publisher developed Magic: The Gathering - Puzzle Quest , combining deck building with match-3-style casual gaming. This was released in December 2015 as a freemium game and continues to be updated with new card sets from the physical game. [168] Cryptic Studios and Perfect World Entertainment have started beta tests for Magic: Legends , a massively multiplayer online action role-playing game for personal computers and consoles. [169] The title was cancelled ahead of its full release in 2021; executive producer Stephen Ricossa explained that the game\'s creative vision had "missed the mark". [170] In addition to official programs, a number of unofficial programs were developed to help user to track their Magic: The Gathering library and allow for rudimentary play between online players. Examples of such programs included Apprentice , Magic Workstation , XMage , and Cockatrice . These programs are not endorsed by Wizards of the Coast. [165] See also: List of Magic: The Gathering novels Harper Prism originally had an exclusive license to produce novels for Magic: The Gathering , and published ten books between 1994 and 1996. Around 1997, the license reverted to Wizards, and the company published its own novels to better tie these works to the expansion sets from 1998 to about 2011. See also: Multiverse (Magic: The Gathering) \u00a7 Comics titles In 1994, Wizards of the Coast gave an exclusive license to Armada Comics, an imprint of Acclaim Entertainment , to publish comic books. The comics were not developed in concert with the game and were created with divergent ideas to the game. [90] [171] However, "much of the lore established" by Armada Comics was "the foundation from which the rest of continuity was built. [...] Some of the details changed (or were \' retconned \', in popular fan speak), but for the most part the core of these stories stayed the same". [171] The comics came to a sudden end in 1996 when Acclaim started to run into financial trouble. [172] In 1998, a new four-issue limited comic series was published by Dark Horse . [172] [173] In September 2011, Hasbro and IDW Publishing accorded to make a four-issue mini-series about Magic: The Gathering [174] with a new story but heavily based on MTG elements and with a new Planeswalker called Dack Fayden , the story of which mainly developed in the planes of Ravnica and Innistrad. The series started in February 2012. [175] In 2018, a four-issue mini-series on the Planeswalker Chandra Nalaar was released. [176] A sequel mini-series was announced in 2019, [177] however, it was cancelled before publication. [178] In January 2021, Boom! Studios acquired the comic license of Magic: The Gathering and announced for a new Magic series for April 2021. [179] [180] In January 2014, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to produce a Magic: The Gathering film with Simon Kinberg as producer and TSG Entertainment (its co-financing partner), and Allspark Pictures as co-financers, after Universal Pictures allegedly dropped the film from their schedule (both Universal and Hasbro had been developing the original Magic: The Gathering film since 2009). [181] In June 2014, Fox hired screenwriter Bryan Cogman to write the script for the film. [182] In 2019 following Disney\'s acquisition of 21st Century Fox\'s assets , the film along with numerous other properties in development at Fox were cancelled. [183] In April 2016, Enter the Battlefield , a documentary about life on the Magic Pro Tour was released. The film was written by Greg Collins, Nathan Holt, and Shawn Kornhauser. [184] The production team behind The Toys That Made Us will produce a documentary Igniting the Spark, The Story of Magic: The Gathering . [185] In June 2019, Variety reported that Joe and Anthony Russo , Wizards of the Coast , and Hasbro\'s Entertainment One have teamed with Netflix for an animated Magic: The Gathering television series. [186] [187] In July 2019 at the San Diego Comic-Con , the Russos revealed the logo of the animated series and spoke about doing a live-action series. [188] [189] During the Magic Showcase virtual event in August 2021, they revealed that Brandon Routh would be the voice of Gideon Jura, and that the series will premiere sometime in 2022. [190] In 1998, PGI Limited created Havic: The Bothering , which was a parody of Magic: The Gathering . Wizards of the Coast, which owned the rights to Magic: The Gathering , took active steps to hinder the distribution of the game and successfully shut out PGI Limited from attending GenCon in July 1998. [191] In an attempt to avoid breaching copyright and Richard Garfield \'s patent, each starter deck of Havic had printed on the back side, "This is a Parody", and on the bottom of the rule card was printed, " Do not have each player : construct their own library of predetermined number of game components by examining and selecting [the] game components from [a] reservoir of game components or you may infringe on U.S. Patent No. 5,662,332 to Garfield." [192] Five official parody expansions of Magic exist: Unglued , Unhinged , Unstable , Unsanctioned , [193] and Unfinity . [194] Most of the cards in these sets feature silver borders and humorous themes. The silver-bordered cards are not legal for play in WPN-sanctioned tournaments. "Typically" is used due to a change in card distribution in Time Spiral which allows premium cards of any rarity to replace Common cards instead of cards of their own rarity. See Purple Reign for more information. While we don\'t like to completely rule anything out, there currently are not any plans to repeat the alternate art within a set model. The main reason is that most players recognize cards through the artwork. Bajari, Patrick; Horta\u00e7su, Ali (January 1, 2004). "Economic Insights from Internet Auctions".

      "Sir Salman Rushdie is the author of many novels including Grimus, Midnight's Children, Shame, The Satanic Verses, The Moor's Last Sigh, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Fury and Shalimar the Clown. He has also published works of non-fiction including The Jaguar Smile, Imaginary Homelands, The Wizard of Oz and, as co-editor, The Vintage Book of Short Stories. The iconic masterpiece of India that introduced the world to \u201ca glittering novelist\u2014one with startling imaginative and intellectual resources, a master of perpetual storytelling\u201d ( The New Yorker ) WINNER OF THE BEST OF THE BOOKERS \u2022 SOON TO BE A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time \u2022 The fortieth anniversary edition, featuring a new introduction by the author Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India\u2019s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India\u2019s 1,000 other \u201cmidnight\u2019s children,\u201d all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. This novel is at once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its people\u2013a brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy. Forty years after its publication, Midnight\u2019s Children stands apart as both an epochal work of fiction and a brilliant performance by one of the great literary voices of our time. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201c[A] torrent of endlessly inventive prose, by turns comic and enraged, embracing life in all its contradictions. In this spectacular novel, verbal pyrotechnics barely outshine its psychological truths.\u201d\u2014 Newsday Winner of the Whitbread Prize One of the most controversial and acclaimed novels ever written, The Satanic Verses is Salman Rushdie\u2019s best-known and most galvanizing book. Set in a modern world filled with both mayhem and miracles, the story begins with a bang: the terrorist bombing of a London-bound jet in midflight. Two Indian actors of opposing sensibilities fall to earth, transformed into living symbols of what is angelic and evil. This is just the initial act in a magnificent odyssey that seamlessly merges the actual with the imagined. A book whose importance is eclipsed only by its quality, The Satanic Verses is a key work of our times. Praise for The Satanic Verses \u201cRushdie is a storyteller of prodigious powers, able to conjure up whole geographies, causalities, climates, creatures, customs, out of thin air.\u201d \u2014 The New York Times Book Review \u201cExhilarating, populous, loquacious, sometimes hilarious, extraordinary . . . a roller-coaster ride over a vast landscape of the imagination.\u201d \u2014 The Guardian (London) \u201cA novel of metamorphoses, hauntings, memories, hallucinations, revelations, advertising jingles, and jokes. Rushdie has the power of description, and we succumb.\u201d \u2014 The Times (London) The novel that set the stage for his modern classic, The Satanic Verses , Shame is Salman Rushdie\u2019s phantasmagoric epic of an unnamed country that is \u201cnot quite Pakistan.\u201d In this dazzling tale of an ongoing duel between the families of two men\u2013one a celebrated wager of war, the other a debauched lover of pleasure\u2013Rushdie brilliantly portrays a world caught between honor and humiliation\u2013\u201cshamelessness, shame: the roots of violence.\u201d Shame is an astonishing story that grows more timely by the day. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 An epic Don Quixote for the modern age, \u201ca brilliant, funny, world-encompassing wonder\u201d ( Time ) from internationally bestselling author Salman Rushdie SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE \u2022 \u201cLovely, unsentimental, heart-affirming . . . a remembrance of what holds our human lives in some equilibrium\u2014a way of feeling and a way of telling. Love and language.\u201d\u2014Jeanette Winterson, The New York Times Book Review NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY TIME AND NPR Inspired by the Cervantes classic, Sam DuChamp, mediocre writer of spy thrillers, creates Quichotte, a courtly, addled salesman obsessed with television who falls in impossible love with a TV star. Together with his (imaginary) son Sancho, Quichotte sets off on a picaresque quest across America to prove worthy of her hand, gallantly braving the tragicomic perils of an age where \u201cAnything-Can-Happen.\u201d Meanwhile, his creator, in a midlife crisis, has equally urgent challenges of his own. Just as Cervantes wrote Don Quixote to satirize the culture of his time, Rushdie takes the reader on a wild ride through a country on the verge of moral and spiritual collapse. And with the kind of storytelling magic that is the hallmark of Rushdie\u2019s work, the fully realized lives of DuChamp and Quichotte intertwine in a profoundly human quest for love and a wickedly entertaining portrait of an age in which fact is so often indiscernible from fiction. Praise for Quichotte \u201cBrilliant . . . a perfect fit for a moment of transcontinental derangement.\u201d \u2014 Financial Times \u201c Quichotte is one of the cleverest, most enjoyable metafictional capers this side of postmodernism. . . . The narration is fleet of foot, always one step ahead of the reader\u2014somewhere between a pinball machine and a three-dimensional game of snakes and ladders. . . . This novel can fly, it can float, it\u2019s anecdotal, effervescent, charming, and a jolly good story to boot.\u201d \u2014 The Sunday Times \u201c Quichotte [is] an updating of Cervantes\u2019s story that proves to be an equally complicated literary encounter, jumbling together a chivalric quest, a satire on Trump\u2019s America and a whole lot of postmodern playfulness in a novel that is as sharp as a flick-knife and as clever as a barrel of monkeys. . . . This is a novel that feeds the heart while it fills the mind.\u201d \u2014 The Times (UK) NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A modern American epic set against the panorama of contemporary politics and culture\u2014a hurtling, page-turning mystery that is equal parts The Great Gatsby and The Bonfire of the Vanities NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR \u2022 PBS \u2022 HARPER\u2019S BAZAAR \u2022 ESQUIRE \u2022 FINANCIAL TIMES \u2022 THE TIMES OF INDIA On the day of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration, an enigmatic billionaire from foreign shores takes up residence in the architectural jewel of \u201cthe Gardens,\u201d a cloistered community in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village. The neighborhood is a bubble within a bubble, and the residents are immediately intrigued by the eccentric newcomer and his family. Along with his improbable name, untraceable accent, and unmistakable whiff of danger, Nero Golden has brought along his three adult sons: agoraphobic, alcoholic Petya, a brilliant recluse with a tortured mind; Apu, the flamboyant artist, sexually and spiritually omnivorous, famous on twenty blocks; and D, at twenty-two the baby of the family, harboring an explosive secret even from himself. There is no mother, no wife; at least not until Vasilisa, a sleek Russian expat, snags the septuagenarian Nero, becoming the queen to his king\u2014a queen in want of an heir. Our guide to the Goldens\u2019 world is their neighbor Ren\u00e9, an ambitious young filmmaker. Researching a movie about the Goldens, he ingratiates himself into their household. Seduced by their mystique, he is inevitably implicated in their quarrels, their infidelities, and, indeed, their crimes. Meanwhile, like a bad joke, a certain comic-book villain embarks upon a crass presidential run that turns New York upside-down. Set against the strange and exuberant backdrop of current American culture and politics, The Golden House also marks Salman Rushdie\u2019s triumphant and exciting return to realism. The result is a modern epic of love and terrorism, loss and reinvention\u2014a powerful, timely story told with the daring and panache that make Salman Rushdie a force of light in our dark new age. Praise for The Golden House \u201c[A] modern masterpiece . . . telling a story full of wonder and leaving you marveling at how it ever came out of the author\u2019s head.\u201d \u2014Associated Press \u201cWildly satiric and yet piercingly real . . . If F. Scott Fitzgerald, Homer, Euripides, and Shakespeare collaborated on a contemporary fall-of-an-empire epic set in New York City, the result would be The Golden House .\u201d \u2014Poets & Writers \u201cA tonic addition to American\u2014no, world!\u2014literature . . . a Greek tragedy with Indian roots and New York coordinates.\u201d \u2014 San Francisco Chronicle Newly collected, revised, and expanded nonfiction from the first two decades of the twenty-first century\u2014including many texts never previously in print\u2014by the Booker Prize\u2013winning, internationally bestselling author Longlisted for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay Salman Rushdie is celebrated as \u201ca master of perpetual storytelling\u201d ( The New Yorker ), illuminating truths about our society and culture through his gorgeous, often searing prose. Now, in his latest collection of nonfiction, he brings together insightful and inspiring essays, criticism, and speeches that focus on his relationship with the written word and solidify his place as one of the most original thinkers of our time. Gathering pieces written between 2003 and 2020, Languages of Truth chronicles Rushdie\u2019s intellectual engagement with a period of momentous cultural shifts. Immersing the reader in a wide variety of subjects, he delves into the nature of storytelling as a human need, and what emerges is, in myriad ways, a love letter to literature itself. Rushdie explores what the work of authors from Shakespeare and Cervantes to Samuel Beckett, Eudora Welty, and Toni Morrison mean to him, whether on the page or in person. He delves deep into the nature of \u201ctruth,\u201d revels in the vibrant malleability of language and the creative lines that can join art and life, and looks anew at migration, multiculturalism, and censorship. Enlivened on every page by Rushdie\u2019s signature wit and dazzling voice, Languages of Truth offers the author\u2019s most piercingly analytical views yet on the evolution of literature and culture even as he takes us on an exhilarating tour of his own exuberant and fearless imagination. On February 14, 1989, Valentine\u2019s Day, Salman Rushdie was telephoned by a BBC journalist and told that he had been \u201csentenced to death\u201d by the Ayatollah Khomeini. For the first time he heard the word fatwa . His crime? To have written a novel called The Satanic Verses, which was accused of being \u201cagainst Islam, the Prophet and the Quran.\u201d So begins the extraordinary story of how a writer was forced underground, moving from house to house, with the constant presence of an armed police protection team. He was asked to choose an alias that the police could call him by. He thought of writers he loved and combinations of their names; then it came to him: Conrad and Chekhov\u2014 Joseph Anton. How do a writer and his family live with the threat of murder for more than nine years? How does he go on working? How does he fall in and out of love? How does despair shape his thoughts and actions, how and why does he stumble, how does he learn to fight back? In this remarkable memoir Rushdie tells that story for the first time; the story of one of the crucial battles, in our time, for freedom of speech. He talks about the sometimes grim, sometimes comic realities of living with armed policemen, and of the close bonds he formed with his protectors; of his struggle for support and understanding from governments, intelligence chiefs, publishers, journalists, and fellow writers; and of how he regained his freedom. It is a book of exceptional frankness and honesty, compelling, provocative, moving, and of vital importance. Because what happened to Salman Rushdie was the first act of a drama that is still unfolding somewhere in the world every day. \u201cA harrowing, deeply felt and revealing document: an autobiographical mirror of the big, philosophical preoccupations that have animated Mr. Rushdie\u2019s work throughout his career.\u201d\u2014Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \u201cThoughtful and astute . . . This is an important book not only because of what it has to say about a man of principle who, under the threat of violence and death, stood firm for freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but also because of its implications about our times and fanatical religious intolerance in a frighteningly fragile world.\u201d\u2014 USA Today (4 out of 4 stars) When Haroun Khalifa\u2019s father, the renowned storyteller Rashid Khalifa, loses his gift of gab, Haroun knows he has to help. Soon, he\u2019s tumbled headfirst into an adventure story of his own, journeying toward the legendary Sea of Stories on the back of a flying Hoopoe bird. There, he finds a host of comical, unforgettable new friends, from Iff the Water Genie to Blabbermouth the page, and at the end of his quest, a formidable enemy \u2013 the Prince of Silence, Khattam-Shud himself. At once vastly humorous and deeply tender, Haroun and the Sea of Stories is a fantastical, witty contemporary fable and a powerful statement about the importance of storytelling. Salman Rushdie has created an instant classic - a dazzling read for children and adults alike that both celebrates and embodies the magic of fiction. A tall, yellow-haired, young European traveler calling himself \u201cMogor dell\u2019Amore,\u201d the Mughal of Love, arrives at the court of the Emperor Akbar, lord of the great Mughal empire, with a tale to tell that begins to obsess the imperial capital, a tale about a mysterious woman, a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery, and her impossible journey to the far-off city of Florence. The Enchantress of Florence is the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man\u2019s world. It is the story of two cities, unknown to each other, at the height of their powers\u2013the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant Akbar the Great wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire, and the treachery of his sons, and the equally sensual city of Florence during the High Renaissance, where Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli takes a starring role as he learns, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. Vivid, gripping, irreverent, bawdy, profoundly moving, and completely absorbing, The Enchantress of Florence is a dazzling book full of wonders by one of the world\u2019s most important living writers. Salman Rushdie's most ambitious and accomplished novel, sure to be hailed as his masterpiece. At the beginning of this stunning novel, Vina Apsara, a famous and much-loved singer, is caught up in a devastating earthquake and never seen again by human eyes. This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks, and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music. Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus's childhood friend and Vina's sometime lover, her \"back-door man,\" the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humor, and love, is perhaps the book's true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age's goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale. Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie's most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act, a vision of our shaken, mutating times, an engagement with the whole of what is and what might be, an account of the intimate, flawed encounter between the East and the West, a brilliant remaking of the myth of Orpheus, a novel of high (and low) comedy, high (and low) passions, high (and low) culture. It is a tale of love, death, and rock 'n' roll. From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Satanic Verses comes nine stories that reveal the oceanic distances and the unexpected intimacies between East and West. Daring, extravagant, comical and humane, this book renews Rushdie's stature as a storyteller who can enthrall and instruct us with the same sentence. Time Magazine's Best Book of the Year Booker Prize-winning author Salman Rushdie combines a ferociously witty family saga with a surreally imagined and sometimes blasphemous chronicle of modern India and flavors the mixture with peppery soliloquies on art, ethnicity, religious fanaticism, and the terrifying power of love. Moraes \"Moor\" Zogoiby, the last surviving scion of a dynasty of Cochinese spice merchants and crime lords, is also a compulsive storyteller and an exile. As he travels a route that takes him from India to Spain, he leaves behind a tale of mad passions and volcanic family hatreds, of titanic matriarchs and their mesmerized offspring, of premature deaths and curses that strike beyond the grave.",

When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed Northern Irish actor Declan Mulholland to stand-in for Jabba the Hutt, wearing a shaggy brown costume. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion creature. The scene was meant to connect Star Wars to Return of the Jedi and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of The Empire Strikes Back . [2] Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget, time constraints, and because he felt that it did not enhance the film's plot. [3] The uncompleted scene, removed from the original version of A New Hope , was included in 1997 version to feature the CGI version of Jabba the Hutt, replacing Mulholland. The CGI Jabba was further polished in the 2004 version. Lucas revisited the scene in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope , restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt. He also replaced the English dialogue with Huttese , a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt . Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford with the crew looking like they had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. [4] [5] The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques. [6] At one point of the original scene, Ford walks behind Mulholland. This became a problem when adding the CGI Jabba since his tail would be in the way. The solution was to have Solo step on Jabba's tail, causing him to grunt in pain. In the 2004 DVD release, Jabba reacts more strongly, winding up as if to punch Han. In this version, shadows of Han can be seen on Jabba's body to make the CGI more convincing. [7] Lucas confessed that people were disappointingly upset about the CGI of Jabba's appearance, complaining that the character \"looked fake\". Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is ultimately portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, it will always be \"fake\" since the character is ultimately not real. He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer. [7] According to Greedo's actor Paul Blake, his own character's scene was created in response to Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene. [8] Image of Bibendum. Figure used is at viewer's right Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi . In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, \"In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature.\" [9] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi , Lucas rejected initial designs of the character. One made Jabba appear too human\u2014almost like a Fu Manchu character\u2014while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum . [10] Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him as some kind of slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland . At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to.\" [11] Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett, [12] Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms , a hairless animal that has no skeleton and are hermaphroditic . Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. Moist, amphibian qualities were given to his skin. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction. [13] In Return of the Jedi , Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture. [10] Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. The puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds , who were members of Jim Henson 's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. The tongue was a light beige color and came out of Jabba\u2019s mouth several times. When he encountered Leia Organa for the first time and enslaved her, he extended his tongue and licked at her face. Leia reacted with such disgust upon seeing the tongue because, in one take, Philpott moved the tongue closer than what Carrie Fisher was comfortable with, and it licked her unintentionally. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men, who also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes, was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control . [1] [7] [10] Design of the Jabba the Hutt puppet for Return of the Jedi Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's appearance and immobility, complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi , Lucas notes that, if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope . [7] Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by the uncredited voice of Larry Ward . A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. [14] A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth. [15] Jabba the Hutt's musical theme throughout the film, composed by John Williams , is played on a tuba . [16] The theme is very similar to one which Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's soundtrack album . Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan, who says that Williams' piece \"blends the monstrous and the lyrical.\" [17] According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau , Jabba the Hutt's death in Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided that Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from The Godfather (1972) where an obese character named Luca Brasi ( Lenny Montana ) is garroted by an assassin. [18] Jabba the Hutt exemplifies lust, greed, and gluttony. [21] The character is known throughout the Star Wars universe as a \"vile gangster\" [22] who amuses himself by torturing and humiliating his subjects and enemies. He surrounds himself with scantily-clad slave girls of all species , chained to his dais . The Star Wars Databank remarks that residents of his palace are not safe from his desire to dominate and torture: [23] in Return of the Jedi , the Twi'lek slave dancer Oola is fed to Jabba's pet rancor. [24] Jabba the Hutt's physical appearance reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant. In Return of the Jedi , Han Solo calls Jabba a \"slimy piece of worm-ridden filth\". Film critic Roger Ebert described him as \"a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat .\" [25] Curiously, the Russian/Ukrainian word for \"toad\" (\u0436\u0430\u0431\u0430 / zhaba) sounds very close to \"Jabba\", while in Arabic \u062d\u064f\u0648\u062a (\u1e25\u016bt) means \"fish / whale\". Science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos wrote that Jabba deserved the \"award for most disgusting alien\". [26] Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch wrote that Jabba's body is a \"miasmic mass\", and that \"[t]he Hutt's lardaceous body seemed to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench\" into the air. [27] Jabba's appetite is insatiable, and some authors portray him threatening to eat his subordinates. [28] [29] The Hollywood Reporter s Arthur Knight called Jabba a \"truly frightening... gross walrus-shaped grotesque.\" [30] Among Jabba's only displays of any positive qualities within the franchise occur in Star Wars: The Clone Wars , where he demonstrates genuine affection for his son Rotta and is worried by his kidnapping and angered by his supposed death. In one Expanded Universe story, Jabba prevents a Chevin named Ephant Mon from freezing to death on an ice planet; afterward, Ephant Mon becomes one of his most loyal servants. [31] Although briefly mentioned by Greedo and Han Solo in Star Wars and again by Han in The Empire Strikes Back , Jabba was first seen in 1983 in Return of the Jedi , the third installment of the original Star Wars trilogy . Directed by Richard Marquand and written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, the first act of Return of the Jedi features the attempts of Princess Leia Organa ( Carrie Fisher ), the Wookiee Chewbacca ( Peter Mayhew ), and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) to rescue their friend, the aforementioned Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ), who had been imprisoned in carbonite in the previous film, The Empire Strikes Back . [32] The captured Han is delivered to Jabba by bounty hunter Boba Fett ( Jeremy Bulloch ) and is placed on display in the crime lord's throne room as a decoration. Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams ), droids C-3PO ( Anthony Daniels ) and R2-D2 ( Kenny Baker ), Leia, and Chewbacca infiltrate Jabba's palace to save Han. Leia is able to free Han from the carbonite, but she is caught and enslaved by the Hutt. Chained to Jabba, she is forced to wear her iconic metal bikini . Luke arrives to \"bargain for Solo's life\", but Jabba rejects his offer and attempts to feed him to his pet rancor , an enormous monster. Luke kills the rancor, with him, Han, and Chewbacca condemned to be devoured by the sarlacc . At the Great Pit of Carkoon, Luke escapes execution with the help of R2-D2 and defeats Jabba's thugs. During the subsequent confusion, Leia chokes Jabba to death with the chain she was tethered to his throne with. Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 escape, and Jabba's sail barge explodes over the sarlacc pit in the background. [32] The second film appearance of Jabba the Hutt was in the Special Edition of Star Wars , [a] which was released in 1997 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its release. In the original version, Han Solo disputes with the alien bounty hunter Greedo ( Paul Blake and Maria De Aragon), whom he kills, and Jabba confirms Greedo's last words and demands that Han pay the value of the payload lost by him. Han promises to compensate Jabba as soon as he receives payment for delivering Obi-Wan Kenobi ( Alec Guinness ), Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO to Alderaan . Jabba agrees, but threatens to place a big price on Solo's head if he fails. Jabba the Hutt made his third film appearance in the 1999 prequel Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace , set 36 years before Return of the Jedi . Jabba gives the order to begin a podrace at Mos Espa on Tatooine. With this done, Jabba falls asleep and misses the race's conclusion. [33] [34] Jabba is referred to in the film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) by a young Han Solo's ( Alden Ehrenreich ) mentor Tobias Beckett ( Woody Harrelson ), who invites Han to join him in working for \"big shot gangster\" on Tatooine. At the end of the film, Han and Chewbacca decide to go to Tatooine for the job. [35] Jabba figures into the plot of the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars , wherein his son Rotta is captured by Separatists, where it is later revealed that Ziro, Jabba's uncle, took part in the kidnapping as part of his plan to take full control of the Hutt Clan. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter ) and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein ) return him to Jabba in exchange for the safe passage of Republic ships through his territory. This is backed up by Padme exposing Ziro's crimes to Jabba, who vows to ensure that Ziro will be punished severely. [36] Jabba subsequently appeared in a handful of episodes of The Clone Wars series , starting in the third season. In the episode \"Sphere of Influence\", wherein Jabba is faced by Chairman Papanoida , whose daughters were kidnapped by Greedo, Jabba allows a sample of Greedo's blood to be taken to prove him the kidnapper. [37] [38] In the episode \"Evil Plans\", Jabba hires the bounty hunter Cad Bane (voiced by Corey Burton ) to bring him plans for the Senate building. When Bane returns successful, Jabba and the Hutt Council send Bane to free Ziro from prison. [39] [40] Jabba next makes a short appearance in the episode \"Hunt for Ziro\" in which he is seen laughing at his uncle's death at the hand of Sy Snootles (voiced by Nika Futterman ), and pays her for delivering Ziro's holo-diary. [36] [41] In the fifth seasons episode \"Eminence\", Jabba and the Hutt Council are approached by Shadow Collective leaders Darth Maul (voiced by Sam Witwer ), Savage Opress (voiced by Clancy Brown ), and Pre Vizsla (voiced by Jon Favreau ); when disappointed by these, Jabba sends bounty hunters Embo (voiced by Dave Filoni ), Dengar (voiced by Simon Pegg ), Sugi (voiced by Anna Graves ), and Latts Razzi (voiced by Clare Grant ) to capture them. After a battle, the Shadow Collective confront Jabba at his palace on Tatooine, where Jabba agrees to an alliance. [42] [43] Jabba as he appears in Marvel Comics' adaptation of the first Star Wars film The first released appearances of Jabba the Hutt in any visual capacity were in Marvel Comics ' adaptation of A New Hope . In Six Against the Galaxy (1977) by Roy Thomas , What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut? (1979) and In Mortal Combat (1980), both by Archie Goodwin , Jabba the Hutt, originally spelled Hut, appeared as a tall humanoid with a walrus -like face, a topknot , and a bright uniform. The official \"Jabba\" was not yet established as he had yet to be seen. [44] While awaiting the sequel to Star Wars , Marvel kept the monthly comic going with their own stories. One of which includes Jabba tracking Han Solo and Chewbacca down to an old hideaway they use for smuggling. However, circumstances force Jabba to lift the bounty on Solo and Chewbacca, enabling them to return to Tatooine for an adventure with Luke Skywalker . In the course of another adventure, Solo kills the space pirate Crimson Jack and busts up his operation, which Jabba bankrolled. Jabba thus renews the reward for Solo's head. Solo later kills a bounty hunter who tells him why he is hunted once more. He and Chewbacca return to the Rebels, where in The Empire Strikes Back Solo mentions an incident with a \"bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell\". [45] [46] The Marvel artists based this Jabba on a character later named Mosep Binneed, an alien visible only briefly in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene of A New Hope . [45] [46] [1] The 1977 mass-market paperback novelization of Lucas's Star Wars script describes Jabba as a \"great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skull\", but gives no further detail as to the character's physical appearance or species . [47] Later Star Wars novels and comics adopt a version of the character's image as seen in the film and greatly elaborate on his background and activities prior to the events of the Star Wars films. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company , all literature in this category was rebranded as Star Wars Legends and designated as non-canonical to any and all new media released after April 2014. [48] [49] [50] Zorba the Hutt's Revenge (1992), a young-adult novel by Paul and Hollace Davids , identifies Jabba's father as another powerful crime lord named Zorba and reveals that Jabba was born 596 years before the events of A New Hope , making him around 600 years old at the time of his death in Return of the Jedi . [51] Four comics exploring Jabba's backstory were written by Jim Woodring and released by Dark Horse Comics in 1995\u201396; these were collected as Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal in 1998. [52] Ann C. Crispin 's novel The Hutt Gambit (1997) explains how Jabba and Han Solo become business associates and portrays the events that lead to a bounty being placed on Han's head. [53] Tales from Jabba's Palace (1996), a collection of short stories edited by Kevin J. Anderson , pieces together the lives of Jabba the Hutt's various minions in his palace and their relationship to him during the last days of his life. These stories reveal that very few of the Hutt's servants are loyal to him, with many plans underway among their ranks to attempt his assassination . When Jabba the Hutt is killed in Return of the Jedi , his surviving former courtiers join forces with his rivals on Tatooine and his family on the Hutt homeworld Nal Hutta make claims to his palace, fortune, and criminal empire. [54] Timothy Zahn 's novel Heir to the Empire (1991) reveals that a smuggler named Talon Karrde eventually replaces Jabba as the \"big fish in the pond\" and moves the headquarters of the Hutt's criminal empire off of Tatooine. [55] Jabba the Hutt has received mixed reviews from critics. The Telegraph said that Jabba the Hutt is one of the \"films' most memorable Star Wars creatures\". [56] Blake Hawkins of Comic Book Resources said that Jabba the Hutt is \"definitely one of the strangest, grossest things in Star Wars\". [57] Jabba the Hutt ranked #5 on the Forbes Fictional 15 list of wealthiest fictional characters in 2008. [58] Business Insider 's Travis Clark said, \"Like Stormtroopers or Darth Vader, some villains just come to mind when you think of Star Wars . Jabba is another one of them.\" [59] Lance Cartelli of GameSpot put Jabba at 12th for the greatest Star Wars villains. [60] Declaring that Jabba is \"without a doubt the finest Star Wars portrait of the id\" and that you have to \"admire his dedication of being his true, absolutely horrendous self\", Jabba made it at Rolling Stone 's 16th position for the 50 best Star Wars characters of all time. [61] Jabba the Hutt as a CGI in the re-release of A New Hope verses as a puppet in Return of the Jedi has been disputed with most saying that he looks better as a puppet. After the Hutt Twins \u2019 first appearance in The Book of Boba Fett , Matt Singer of ScreenCrush wrote that no Hutt species should ever be CGI as it does not \"look real\". [62] TheWrap s Phil Owen said that the CGI Jabba looked \"incredibly horrible\". [63] Matt Goldberg of Collider also said, \"The CGI Jabba the Hutt looked awful.\" [64] The Denver Post applauded the special effects team on Return of the Jedi for making Jabba look like a \"horrid creature\". [65] Outside literature, the character's name has become an insulting term of disparagement . To say that someone \"looks like Jabba the Hutt\" is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person's weight or appearance. [66] It has also come to represent greed and anarchy , especially in the business world. [67] Lindsey Boylan , the first accuser of New York's 56th Governor Andrew Cuomo for sexual harassment , compared Cuomo to Jabba the Hutt. [68] Robin Mukherjee wrote about what inner selves were like and described his \"inner self\" to Jabba the Hutt, stating: \"It is pleasure-seeking to the point of gluttonous, has a sense of lust that seems to never be satisfied, and personifies the sin of sloth.\" [69] The Turkish Cultural Community of Austria called out a Lego toy set of Jabba's palace of being racially biased of two religious structures in Turkey. They stated it was clear as what it was going for as Jabba the Hutt is a \"racial prejudice and vulgar insinuations against \u2026 Orientals and Asians as sneaky and criminal personalities.\" [70] Carrie Fisher , actress of Princess Leia , said that if Donald Trump were to play a Star Wars character it would be Jabba the Hutt, because of the sexual allegations against him. [71] With the premiere of Return of the Jedi in 1983 and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt has extended his popularity in other things besides Star Wars . The character was produced and marketed as a series of action figure play sets by Kenner / Hasbro from 1983 to 2004. [72] In the 1990s, Jabba the Hutt starred in his own comic book series, Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal, which is a reference to the book of the same title by Donald Trump . [73] In Mel Brooks ' Star Wars spoof film Spaceballs (1987), Jabba the Hutt is parodied as the character Pizza the Hutt , a cheesy blob shaped like a slice of pizza whose name is a double pun on Jabba the Hutt and the restaurant franchise Pizza Hut . [74] The Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C ., included a display on Jabba the Hutt in the temporary exhibition Star Wars: The Magic of Myth , which closed in 1999. Jabba's display was called \"The Hero's Return,\" referencing Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi. [75] In 2012, a reduced scale of Jabba's barge, the Khetanna, was created in Huntington Beach, California , as a parade float for a Star Wars- themed charity relay.

      "Sir Salman Rushdie is the author of many novels including Grimus, Midnight's Children, Shame, The Satanic Verses, The Moor's Last Sigh, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Fury and Shalimar the Clown. He has also published works of non-fiction including The Jaguar Smile, Imaginary Homelands, The Wizard of Oz and, as co-editor, The Vintage Book of Short Stories. The iconic masterpiece of India that introduced the world to \u201ca glittering novelist\u2014one with startling imaginative and intellectual resources, a master of perpetual storytelling\u201d ( The New Yorker ) WINNER OF THE BEST OF THE BOOKERS \u2022 SOON TO BE A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time \u2022 The fortieth anniversary edition, featuring a new introduction by the author Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India\u2019s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India\u2019s 1,000 other \u201cmidnight\u2019s children,\u201d all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. This novel is at once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its people\u2013a brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy. Forty years after its publication, Midnight\u2019s Children stands apart as both an epochal work of fiction and a brilliant performance by one of the great literary voices of our time. #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201c[A] torrent of endlessly inventive prose, by turns comic and enraged, embracing life in all its contradictions. In this spectacular novel, verbal pyrotechnics barely outshine its psychological truths.\u201d\u2014 Newsday Winner of the Whitbread Prize One of the most controversial and acclaimed novels ever written, The Satanic Verses is Salman Rushdie\u2019s best-known and most galvanizing book. Set in a modern world filled with both mayhem and miracles, the story begins with a bang: the terrorist bombing of a London-bound jet in midflight. Two Indian actors of opposing sensibilities fall to earth, transformed into living symbols of what is angelic and evil. This is just the initial act in a magnificent odyssey that seamlessly merges the actual with the imagined. A book whose importance is eclipsed only by its quality, The Satanic Verses is a key work of our times. Praise for The Satanic Verses \u201cRushdie is a storyteller of prodigious powers, able to conjure up whole geographies, causalities, climates, creatures, customs, out of thin air.\u201d \u2014 The New York Times Book Review \u201cExhilarating, populous, loquacious, sometimes hilarious, extraordinary . . . a roller-coaster ride over a vast landscape of the imagination.\u201d \u2014 The Guardian (London) \u201cA novel of metamorphoses, hauntings, memories, hallucinations, revelations, advertising jingles, and jokes. Rushdie has the power of description, and we succumb.\u201d \u2014 The Times (London) NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 An epic Don Quixote for the modern age, \u201ca brilliant, funny, world-encompassing wonder\u201d ( Time ) from internationally bestselling author Salman Rushdie SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE \u2022 \u201cLovely, unsentimental, heart-affirming . . . a remembrance of what holds our human lives in some equilibrium\u2014a way of feeling and a way of telling. Love and language.\u201d\u2014Jeanette Winterson, The New York Times Book Review NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY TIME AND NPR Inspired by the Cervantes classic, Sam DuChamp, mediocre writer of spy thrillers, creates Quichotte, a courtly, addled salesman obsessed with television who falls in impossible love with a TV star. Together with his (imaginary) son Sancho, Quichotte sets off on a picaresque quest across America to prove worthy of her hand, gallantly braving the tragicomic perils of an age where \u201cAnything-Can-Happen.\u201d Meanwhile, his creator, in a midlife crisis, has equally urgent challenges of his own. Just as Cervantes wrote Don Quixote to satirize the culture of his time, Rushdie takes the reader on a wild ride through a country on the verge of moral and spiritual collapse. And with the kind of storytelling magic that is the hallmark of Rushdie\u2019s work, the fully realized lives of DuChamp and Quichotte intertwine in a profoundly human quest for love and a wickedly entertaining portrait of an age in which fact is so often indiscernible from fiction. Praise for Quichotte \u201cBrilliant . . . a perfect fit for a moment of transcontinental derangement.\u201d \u2014 Financial Times \u201c Quichotte is one of the cleverest, most enjoyable metafictional capers this side of postmodernism. . . . The narration is fleet of foot, always one step ahead of the reader\u2014somewhere between a pinball machine and a three-dimensional game of snakes and ladders. . . . This novel can fly, it can float, it\u2019s anecdotal, effervescent, charming, and a jolly good story to boot.\u201d \u2014 The Sunday Times \u201c Quichotte [is] an updating of Cervantes\u2019s story that proves to be an equally complicated literary encounter, jumbling together a chivalric quest, a satire on Trump\u2019s America and a whole lot of postmodern playfulness in a novel that is as sharp as a flick-knife and as clever as a barrel of monkeys. . . . This is a novel that feeds the heart while it fills the mind.\u201d \u2014 The Times (UK) The novel that set the stage for his modern classic, The Satanic Verses , Shame is Salman Rushdie\u2019s phantasmagoric epic of an unnamed country that is \u201cnot quite Pakistan.\u201d In this dazzling tale of an ongoing duel between the families of two men\u2013one a celebrated wager of war, the other a debauched lover of pleasure\u2013Rushdie brilliantly portrays a world caught between honor and humiliation\u2013\u201cshamelessness, shame: the roots of violence.\u201d Shame is an astonishing story that grows more timely by the day. Newly collected, revised, and expanded nonfiction from the first two decades of the twenty-first century\u2014including many texts never previously in print\u2014by the Booker Prize\u2013winning, internationally bestselling author Longlisted for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay Salman Rushdie is celebrated as \u201ca master of perpetual storytelling\u201d ( The New Yorker ), illuminating truths about our society and culture through his gorgeous, often searing prose. Now, in his latest collection of nonfiction, he brings together insightful and inspiring essays, criticism, and speeches that focus on his relationship with the written word and solidify his place as one of the most original thinkers of our time. Gathering pieces written between 2003 and 2020, Languages of Truth chronicles Rushdie\u2019s intellectual engagement with a period of momentous cultural shifts. Immersing the reader in a wide variety of subjects, he delves into the nature of storytelling as a human need, and what emerges is, in myriad ways, a love letter to literature itself. Rushdie explores what the work of authors from Shakespeare and Cervantes to Samuel Beckett, Eudora Welty, and Toni Morrison mean to him, whether on the page or in person. He delves deep into the nature of \u201ctruth,\u201d revels in the vibrant malleability of language and the creative lines that can join art and life, and looks anew at migration, multiculturalism, and censorship. Enlivened on every page by Rushdie\u2019s signature wit and dazzling voice, Languages of Truth offers the author\u2019s most piercingly analytical views yet on the evolution of literature and culture even as he takes us on an exhilarating tour of his own exuberant and fearless imagination. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A modern American epic set against the panorama of contemporary politics and culture\u2014a hurtling, page-turning mystery that is equal parts The Great Gatsby and The Bonfire of the Vanities NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR \u2022 PBS \u2022 HARPER\u2019S BAZAAR \u2022 ESQUIRE \u2022 FINANCIAL TIMES \u2022 THE TIMES OF INDIA On the day of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration, an enigmatic billionaire from foreign shores takes up residence in the architectural jewel of \u201cthe Gardens,\u201d a cloistered community in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village. The neighborhood is a bubble within a bubble, and the residents are immediately intrigued by the eccentric newcomer and his family. Along with his improbable name, untraceable accent, and unmistakable whiff of danger, Nero Golden has brought along his three adult sons: agoraphobic, alcoholic Petya, a brilliant recluse with a tortured mind; Apu, the flamboyant artist, sexually and spiritually omnivorous, famous on twenty blocks; and D, at twenty-two the baby of the family, harboring an explosive secret even from himself. There is no mother, no wife; at least not until Vasilisa, a sleek Russian expat, snags the septuagenarian Nero, becoming the queen to his king\u2014a queen in want of an heir. Our guide to the Goldens\u2019 world is their neighbor Ren\u00e9, an ambitious young filmmaker. Researching a movie about the Goldens, he ingratiates himself into their household. Seduced by their mystique, he is inevitably implicated in their quarrels, their infidelities, and, indeed, their crimes. Meanwhile, like a bad joke, a certain comic-book villain embarks upon a crass presidential run that turns New York upside-down. Set against the strange and exuberant backdrop of current American culture and politics, The Golden House also marks Salman Rushdie\u2019s triumphant and exciting return to realism. The result is a modern epic of love and terrorism, loss and reinvention\u2014a powerful, timely story told with the daring and panache that make Salman Rushdie a force of light in our dark new age. Praise for The Golden House \u201c[A] modern masterpiece . . . telling a story full of wonder and leaving you marveling at how it ever came out of the author\u2019s head.\u201d \u2014Associated Press \u201cWildly satiric and yet piercingly real . . . If F. Scott Fitzgerald, Homer, Euripides, and Shakespeare collaborated on a contemporary fall-of-an-empire epic set in New York City, the result would be The Golden House .\u201d \u2014Poets & Writers \u201cA tonic addition to American\u2014no, world!\u2014literature . . . a Greek tragedy with Indian roots and New York coordinates.\u201d \u2014 San Francisco Chronicle On February 14, 1989, Valentine\u2019s Day, Salman Rushdie was telephoned by a BBC journalist and told that he had been \u201csentenced to death\u201d by the Ayatollah Khomeini. For the first time he heard the word fatwa . His crime? To have written a novel called The Satanic Verses, which was accused of being \u201cagainst Islam, the Prophet and the Quran.\u201d So begins the extraordinary story of how a writer was forced underground, moving from house to house, with the constant presence of an armed police protection team. He was asked to choose an alias that the police could call him by. He thought of writers he loved and combinations of their names; then it came to him: Conrad and Chekhov\u2014 Joseph Anton. How do a writer and his family live with the threat of murder for more than nine years? How does he go on working? How does he fall in and out of love? How does despair shape his thoughts and actions, how and why does he stumble, how does he learn to fight back? In this remarkable memoir Rushdie tells that story for the first time; the story of one of the crucial battles, in our time, for freedom of speech. He talks about the sometimes grim, sometimes comic realities of living with armed policemen, and of the close bonds he formed with his protectors; of his struggle for support and understanding from governments, intelligence chiefs, publishers, journalists, and fellow writers; and of how he regained his freedom. It is a book of exceptional frankness and honesty, compelling, provocative, moving, and of vital importance. Because what happened to Salman Rushdie was the first act of a drama that is still unfolding somewhere in the world every day. \u201cA harrowing, deeply felt and revealing document: an autobiographical mirror of the big, philosophical preoccupations that have animated Mr. Rushdie\u2019s work throughout his career.\u201d\u2014Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \u201cThoughtful and astute . . . This is an important book not only because of what it has to say about a man of principle who, under the threat of violence and death, stood firm for freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but also because of its implications about our times and fanatical religious intolerance in a frighteningly fragile world.\u201d\u2014 USA Today (4 out of 4 stars) When Haroun Khalifa\u2019s father, the renowned storyteller Rashid Khalifa, loses his gift of gab, Haroun knows he has to help. Soon, he\u2019s tumbled headfirst into an adventure story of his own, journeying toward the legendary Sea of Stories on the back of a flying Hoopoe bird. There, he finds a host of comical, unforgettable new friends, from Iff the Water Genie to Blabbermouth the page, and at the end of his quest, a formidable enemy \u2013 the Prince of Silence, Khattam-Shud himself. At once vastly humorous and deeply tender, Haroun and the Sea of Stories is a fantastical, witty contemporary fable and a powerful statement about the importance of storytelling. Salman Rushdie has created an instant classic - a dazzling read for children and adults alike that both celebrates and embodies the magic of fiction. A tall, yellow-haired, young European traveler calling himself \u201cMogor dell\u2019Amore,\u201d the Mughal of Love, arrives at the court of the Emperor Akbar, lord of the great Mughal empire, with a tale to tell that begins to obsess the imperial capital, a tale about a mysterious woman, a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery, and her impossible journey to the far-off city of Florence. The Enchantress of Florence is the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man\u2019s world. It is the story of two cities, unknown to each other, at the height of their powers\u2013the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant Akbar the Great wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire, and the treachery of his sons, and the equally sensual city of Florence during the High Renaissance, where Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli takes a starring role as he learns, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. Vivid, gripping, irreverent, bawdy, profoundly moving, and completely absorbing, The Enchantress of Florence is a dazzling book full of wonders by one of the world\u2019s most important living writers. Salman Rushdie's most ambitious and accomplished novel, sure to be hailed as his masterpiece. At the beginning of this stunning novel, Vina Apsara, a famous and much-loved singer, is caught up in a devastating earthquake and never seen again by human eyes. This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks, and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music. Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus's childhood friend and Vina's sometime lover, her \"back-door man,\" the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humor, and love, is perhaps the book's true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age's goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale. Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie's most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act, a vision of our shaken, mutating times, an engagement with the whole of what is and what might be, an account of the intimate, flawed encounter between the East and the West, a brilliant remaking of the myth of Orpheus, a novel of high (and low) comedy, high (and low) passions, high (and low) culture. It is a tale of love, death, and rock 'n' roll. From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Satanic Verses comes nine stories that reveal the oceanic distances and the unexpected intimacies between East and West. Daring, extravagant, comical and humane, this book renews Rushdie's stature as a storyteller who can enthrall and instruct us with the same sentence. Time Magazine's Best Book of the Year Booker Prize-winning author Salman Rushdie combines a ferociously witty family saga with a surreally imagined and sometimes blasphemous chronicle of modern India and flavors the mixture with peppery soliloquies on art, ethnicity, religious fanaticism, and the terrifying power of love. Moraes \"Moor\" Zogoiby, the last surviving scion of a dynasty of Cochinese spice merchants and crime lords, is also a compulsive storyteller and an exile. As he travels a route that takes him from India to Spain, he leaves behind a tale of mad passions and volcanic family hatreds, of titanic matriarchs and their mesmerized offspring, of premature deaths and curses that strike beyond the grave.",

      "I have seen and heard a lot about the slow turn around times at CGC and for many of us, its not how things used to be. CGC clearly have too much work post Covid and taking on more people in such a specialised and customer sensitive business can't be easy. I would however, say that there are certain people out there who don't help the situation at all by sending in 20, 30, 50, comics at a time and then, complain about the quality of service and grades they get. Just browse Youtube and you will see them sitting next to huge piles of their newly returned submissions. eg. Comic Book Investments Mint Hunter Comics If you scale this up across the market, no wonder it takes so long for CGC to process the submissions. People such as these, are hogging the process and clogging the CGC system to the detrement of other users. My answer to them is, be more responsible and stop submitting 100's of comics to CGC. You just might bring about a better and quicker service for everyone ? Edited 12 hours ago by Colin Nash\nOn 3/4/2022 at 11:38 AM, mattn792 said: Maybe this an overly greedy capitalist viewpoint, but I look at it like this - they aren't hiding anything, CGC is pretty forthright that TATs are _ucked up now and for the foreseeable future. And it's also a topic that is widely discussed on these very boards. But multi-month TATs or no, people keep sending their books. Even with two known competitors in the marketplace, albeit with one of them being more punchline than competitor. So unless and until customers change their habits en masse, I doubt CGC leadership will see any reason to change course. In fact, I'd interpret the constant demand as a sign that the short and long games are equally healthy right now because customers are willing to wait nearly a year to get their 9.2 copies of Amazing Spider-Man 379 back (shout out to @BITCOINSWAMI ). The key words in your statement are \"right now\". Which is true. In this market, CGC can pretty much do what they want and screw up as much as they want and people are still going to submit. But \"right now\" isn't the long game. PSA, Beckett, WATA, and VGA are looking beyond that. I've been a supporter and defender of CGC since they opened their doors for over two decades. I find myself no longer being able to do that and CGC doesn't seem to care much what people think of them, because the gravy is flowing like a waterfall. What happens when the gravy thins out or one of the other deep pocketed companies sees that dip in trust and decides to step into the market and CGC finds out that those staunch supporters over the last 20 years no longer have the loyalty that they used to? That's the long game....and many of the grading companies seem to be looking at it from that perspective. Unfortunately, not all of them are. Will CGC ever lose their top dog position? Maybe not. But their actions are those of a company that doesn't believe it could ever happen. Edited 2 hours ago by Domo Arigato",
